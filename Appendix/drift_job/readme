= Drift job =

== 1. Description ==

Drift job is a simple beaker job to run fs-drift <bengland@redhat.com> on a file system, while gathering info about fragmentation. After fs-drift is done, metadata image is created and sent to server.

To successfully execute a task, you have to already have your device and file system configured. For that purpose, please use storage_generator. The runtest.sh script takes these arguments:
-s, do or do not sync with server (1 to do, 0 to not)
-r, fs-drift parameters in format: -option_args-option2_args2. EXAMPLE: -r -t_/RHTSSpareLUN1-d_500 (will run fs-drift on /RHTSspareLUN1 for 500 seconds)
-d, device on which the testing folder is mounted on (/dev/sda1, /dev/mapper/vg-testLV1)
only one argument, which is a string of fs-drift parameters.

Example:
runtest.sh -s 0 -r -t_/RHTSspareLUN1-d_500 -d /dev/sda1

The output is 3 files:
$RESULT.tar.xz, containing logs
$RESULT.properties, containing info about test
$RESULT.bz2, containing metadata image

== 2. fs-drift ==

fs-drift is a file system ageing test designed to run mixed workload on a file system.

The ratio of executed operations is:

 * read,10
 * create,30
 * append,60
 * delete,5
 * rename,1

This is specified in my_workload.csv file, if you want to have different distribution fork the drift_job and either edit that file, or create a new one and refer it in multi_thread_config.sh.

If you want to fill a file system, follow instructions:

'To fill up a filesystem, just specify a --max-files and a mean file size such that the product is much greater than the filesystem's space.' 

== 3. Beaker task ==
Example:
<task name="/performance/drift_job" role="STANDALONE">
     <params>
          <param name="TEST_PARAM_DRIFT_JOB" value="-s 0 -r -t_/RHTSspareLUN1-d_500 -d /dev/sda1"/>
     </params>
</task>

storage for connor using:
-s create -f xfs -t single -m /RHTSspareLUN1 -d /dev/sda -T 4SASHDD_xfs
